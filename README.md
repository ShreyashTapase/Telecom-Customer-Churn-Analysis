# Telecom-Customer-Churn-Analysis

**Executive Summary:**

This project focuses on identifying key drivers of customer churn using a dataset of 7,043 customers from a telecom company. The primary objective was to analyze customer behavior, understand churn patterns, and provide actionable insights to enhance customer retention.

**Key Insights:**
- Churn Rate: Approximately 26.5% of customers have churned, highlighting the importance of addressing customer retention proactively.

- Tenure and Churn: Customers with shorter tenures (1â€“2 months) are significantly more likely to churn, whereas long-term customers demonstrate higher retention.

- Contract Type: Customers on month-to-month contracts show the highest churn rates compared to those on one- or two-year contracts.

**Service Usage:**

- Customers lacking value-added services such as Online Security, Tech Support, and Device Protection are more likely to churn.

- Churn is noticeably higher among users of Fiber Optic internet compared to DSL users.

**Demographics:**

- Senior Citizens show higher churn rates than non-senior customers.

- Gender appears to have a minimal impact on churn behavior.

- Payment Methods: The highest churn is observed among customers using Electronic Check as a payment method.

- Billing Preferences: Customers who opt for paperless billing also show a higher tendency to churn.

**Data Handling & Methodology:**
- The dataset was cleaned by converting blank values in the TotalCharges column to numeric format.

- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) was performed using visualization libraries like Seaborn and Matplotlib to identify patterns and correlations.

- Count plots, histograms, and pie charts were used to highlight trends across different features.

**Recommendations:**
- Promote long-term contracts through discounts or incentives to reduce month-to-month churn.

- Bundle value-added services (e.g., security, support) to increase customer stickiness.

- Improve Fiber Optic service quality or provide alternative solutions to affected customers.

- Enhance engagement with senior citizens through personalized support.

- Encourage alternative payment methods that show lower churn behavior, such as automatic bank withdrawals or credit cards.
